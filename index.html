        <p>
            Jessica was born and raised just outside Atlanta, Georgia. She graduated from Kennesaw State University with a B.B.A in Finance.  She learned her web development skills from Georgia Tech by becoming a full time student again at age 39 while attending a full-stack coding bootcamp offered through the university. She now applies those coding skills to both front and back end web development. When Jessica is not behind the computer she is probably spending her time on the Beltline with her dog Preston or exploring the ever evolving restaurant scene in Atlanta.
